## 🤝 Contributing

### Local Development Flow
1. Create a new branch for your feature
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit frequently
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'feat: add new feature component'
   git commit -m 'feat: implement feature logic'
   git commit -m 'test: add tests for new feature'
   ```

3. Keep your branch up to date by rebasing with main
   ```bash
   # Update your local main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main

   # Rebase your feature branch
   git checkout feature/amazing-feature
   git rebase main

   # If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. Push your branch to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

   If you've rebased your branch and get a push rejection, use force-push:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
   
   > ⚠️ **Note**: Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` as it's safer. It will prevent you from overwriting others' work if someone else has pushed to your branch.

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
2. Ensure the PR title follows the commit convention
3. Request reviews from team members
